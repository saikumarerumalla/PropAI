## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid orange (#FFA500), evokes feelings of energy and optimism, aligning with the excitement of finding the right property.
- Background color: Light orange (#FFF3E0), a very desaturated tint of the primary that keeps the interface bright but calm.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFC34D), complements the primary hue with a bit more brightness, drawing attention to key actions and information.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and short chunks of text, with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, giving the site a contemporary feel.
- Use clear and direct icons for property details (size, beds, location), maintaining simplicity.
- Use a clear, single-column layout to maximize clarity.
- Loading animations should be short, using smooth transitions. Emphasize seamless integration in user interaction.
